Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy Specificaion
Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify aspects of
Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a common
source.

The guppy top-level package contains the following subpackages:

etc     Support modules. Contains especially the Glue protocol module.

gsl     The Guppy Specification Language implementation. This can
        be used to create documents and tests from a common source.

heapy   The heap analysis toolset. It can be used to find information
        about the objects in the heap and display the information
        in various ways.

sets    Bitsets and 'nodesets' implemented in C.
