I am happy to announce Guppy-PE 0.1.9

Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

The main news in this release:

o A patch by Chad Austin to compile with Visual Studio 2003 and Python
  2.5 C compilers. I think this may fix similar problems with other
  Microsoft compilers.

o Tentative interactive help system, providing a .doc attribute that
  can be used to get info on available attributes in text form and
  also by invoking a browser.

Begin Example

>>> from guppy import hpy;hp=hpy()
>>> hp.doc
Top level interface to Heapy. Available attributes:
Anything            Nothing             Via                 iso
...

>>> hp.doc.doc
Overview documentation for top level Heapy object.
Provides a listing of the available attributes.
Accessing the attribute name on the doc objects gives further info, eg:

>>> hp.doc.heap

gives doc for the heap method when hp is the top level Heapy object.

References may be embedded in the documentations. To access a
reference, opening up a web browser with the doc for it one can do eg:

>>> hp.doc.heap[1]

The reference number 0 is special. If it is provided, it is the
reference to the html doc for the described object itself. So to see
in the web browser the doc for the heap method one can do:

>>> hp.doc.heap[0]

End Example
