I am happy to announce Guppy-PE 0.1.9

Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python,
currently providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports
object and heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also
includes a prototypical specification language, the Guppy
Specification Language (GSL), which can be used to formally specify
aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a
common source.

The main news in this release:

o A patch by Chad Austin to compile with Visual Studio 2003 and Python
  2.5 C compilers. I think this may fix similar problems with other
  Microsoft compilers.

o Interactive help system, providing a .doc attribute that can be used
  to get info on available attributes in text form and also by
  invoking a browser.

o New documentation file, heapy_tutorial.html.  It contains for now an
  example of how to get started and use the interactive help.

o Bug fix wrt pop for mutable bitset. (Not used in heapy, only in
  sets/test.py)

o guppy.hpy().test() now includes the set-specific tests.

o Remote monitor does not longer require readline library being installed.
